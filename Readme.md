# The Mathematics Repository

The mathematics repo contains fun spreadsheets which explore simple mathematical concepts.
These interactive spreadsheets help to achieve an intuitive understanding of the concepts.

### Benford's Law
  
  For many sets of numerical data, the frequency distribution of the leftmost digit of each
  member of the data-set will approximate the predicted value of Benford's Law.  See Wikipedia
  for an in depth discussion of Benford's Law.
  
  This worksheet tests Benford's Law using calculated values of the circumference and area
  of a circle.  The user can change the radius growth rate and the number base in order to
  observe how the frequency distribution and predicted value changes.

### Change of Base

  This worksheet takes 'From base', 'To base', and 'Number' inputs and displays the conversion
  from the starting base to base 10, then from base 10 to the ending base.  The conversion of
  each digit is illustrated along the way.

### Transforms

  These interactive worksheets include graphs of two triangles - one original and one transformed.
  The transform matrix and the translate matrix allow the user to perform various transformations 
  beginning with the identity matrix, reflections, rotations, dilations, shears, and translations.

### Hanoi Towers Puzzle

  This worksheet is an exploration of the optimal number of moves required to solve a Hanoi
  Towers puzzle with three rods and varying numbers of discs.  By evaluating the results, a
  recursive formula calculating the number of moves required is discovered.

### Coffee Problem

  This is a proof that the proportion of milk to coffee is the same in both cups after 
  the following steps are performed...
  
  There are two cups.
  The first cup contains only coffee.
  The second cup contains only milk.
  Take a spoon of coffee from the first cup and add it to the second cup.  
  After that, take one spoon of the liquid in the second cup and add it to the first cup. 
  What is larger, the amount of milk in the first cup or the amount of coffee in the second cup?

### Temperature

  This is a study of the high and low temperatures by day of year in both Houston and Tucson.
  The curves approximate real data using trigonometric functions.
